Certainly! Here are the objectives and goals for your Spring Boot application:

Objective:
The objective of our project is to develop a robust audit application using Spring Boot that efficiently logs information about the changes a payload undergoes. By leveraging the power of Swagger API and JSON data, our application aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for creating, updating, and patching logs. Through comprehensive testing, we ensure the accuracy and reliability of the application, enabling organizations to track and monitor payload changes effectively.

Goals:
1. Develop a Spring Boot application with Swagger API integration: Our primary goal is to create an audit application that utilizes the Spring Boot framework, enabling seamless integration of Swagger API. This integration will provide a standardized and interactive documentation interface for managing the payload logs.

2. Support CRUD operations for payload logs: The application should allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on the payload logs. Users should be able to create new logs, retrieve existing logs, update logs with complete or partial information, and delete logs when necessary.

3. Enable partial updates using patching: Our application aims to support partial updates through the patching method. This functionality allows users to modify specific attributes or fields within a payload log without altering the entire log. It provides flexibility and efficiency when making changes to payload information.

4. Implement comprehensive test cases: To ensure the accuracy, reliability, and stability of our application, we will create a suite of test cases. These test cases will cover various scenarios, including creating logs, updating logs, patching logs, and validating the expected behavior and outcomes of each operation.

5. Provide a user-friendly interface and documentation: User experience is a key focus of our project. We aim to develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the audit application. Additionally, comprehensive documentation will be provided to guide users in utilizing the API endpoints effectively and understanding the application's capabilities.

6. Ensure data security and integrity: The project prioritizes the security and integrity of the logged information. Implementing robust security measures, including encryption protocols, access controls, and authentication mechanisms, is crucial to safeguarding the audit data from unauthorized access or tampering.

7. Enhance performance and scalability: Our application should be designed and optimized to handle a large volume of payload logs efficiently. Through proper database management, code optimization, and caching mechanisms, we aim to enhance the performance and scalability of the application, ensuring its smooth operation even under high load conditions.

By achieving these objectives and goals, our project will deliver a reliable and feature-rich audit application that empowers organizations to effectively track, monitor, and analyze the changes their payloads undergo, while maintaining data integrity and security.
